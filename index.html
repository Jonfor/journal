        Finally, after twenty-six years, the Tergs
        are defeated. Our people shall never
        know of my sacrifice. I have given so
        much, but my family’s ancestral lands
        are free once again and I have avenged
        the death of Father.
    </p>
    <p>
        Pathetic cowards that they were, the
        Tergs fled west to a small valley in the
        Balinok mountains to hide and lick their
        wounds. Looking back now, it astounds
        me how their barbarian hordes, with
        terrifying speed, overtook our entire
        nation nearly shattering its power,
        unseating my family, but I slaughtered
        them all!
    </p>
    <p>
        I thundered across the land like the
        wrath of a just god, and it was my justice
        that brought peace to the valley. I claim
        the right to rule over this land and all
        lands reclaimed from those barbarians.
        The peasantry is grateful to, once again,
        be under the rule of a von Zarovich. This
        is my just reward.

        I have decreed the land “Barovia,” after
        Father, and shall rebuild our ancestral
        castle to commemorate our greatness!
    </p>
    <p>
        Strahd von Zarovich, savior of the von
        Zarovich name! Our line shall reign as
        Lords of men forever!
    </p>
    <p>
        My army has settled in the valley of
        Barovia and have taken power over the
        people in the name of a just god, but
        with none of a god’s grace or justice.
        The…Barovians, that is a good name for
        them, are a simple people…innocent,
        they need to be taught what is wrong
        and right, like babies.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am collecting wizards and artisans
        from across the land and have decreed
        the construction of a castle to rival the
        magnificent fortress of our ancestral
        homeland. I shall name it Ravenloft
        after my beloved Mother.
        Perhaps she will appreciate that…

        Khazan informs me the construction of
        Castle Ravenloft nears completion.
    </p>
    <p>
        The pillar that we construct upon is a
        towering plateau, one thousand feet
        high. It shall be the perfect defense
        against attackers. Our home shall never
        again be sieged so easily!
    </p>
    <p>
        It also gives me a beautiful view of the
        valley and the little hamlet that I have
        named the Village of Barovia.

        I admit, with Castle Ravenloft complete,
        I did not expect my first Royal Visitors to
        be a group of Wild Druids.
    </p>
    <p>
        Too long had they suffered at the hand
        of lesser men they come seeking
        patronage and safety. They see me as
        the savior I am.
    </p>
    <p>
        When asked what they offered in return
        for my protection they said “Ancient
        secrets” – hidden knowledge that they
        claim will allow me control over the
        Swamps, Forests, and Mountains of
        Barovia.
    </p>
    <p>
        My interest was piqued.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thrice did they lead me to these ancient
        places. As I stood in these sanctums
        and felt their primal, old magic, I
        determined that these too must be
        conquered.

        I have been in contact with Mother,
        and… I-
    </p>
    <p>
        I have a younger brother. Shortly before
        Father joined me in the crusades,
        Mother became with child. I am
        overjoyed for her…for us, the von
        Zarovich family… for there is another to
        add greatness to our name.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am…. perplexed, however. Her
        previous correspondences had no
        mention of him. There have been many
        opportunities over the last twenty-five
        years to tell me I had a sibling…our last
        missive explained as much…twenty-five
        years. How? Why could Mother keep
        such joyous news from me?
    </p>
    <p>
        Understandably I am…
    </p>
    <p class="text-center">…cross.</p>
    <p>
        As Master of the family, I have
        commanded my Mother and Little
        Brother…Sergei… join me in our new
        home.

        I have been granted a vision. I saw
        Mother. She feared me and that is why
        she kept Sergei a secret from me? Say
        it isn’t so…
    </p>
    <p>
        I wanted from her what any son
        wants…
    </p>
    <p>
        Love.
    </p>
    <p>
        But she Spurned me.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cold…Arrogant?!
    </p>
    <p>
        She secreted Sergei away and visited
        upon HIM all her love and attention!
    </p>
    <p>
        I saved our family. I freed our lands. I
        avenged Father. I was exactly what I
        needed to be.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mark me, I shall get what I was denied
        by Mother from Sergei, she will see! All
        the love that was lavished upon him, he
        shall return to me tenfold!

        Mother did not make the journey.
    </p>
    <p>
        Her carriage fell to….to disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
        She…died. My beloved mother died.
    </p>
    <p>
        She will never get to see her namesake.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sergei and I mourn together. We have
        sealed her body alongside Father’s in
        the crypt below the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sergei…My unknown younger brother.
    </p>
    <p>
        The receptacle of our Mother’s love.
    </p>
    <p>
        He comes bringing me a gift of
        reverence. A sword with a crystal blade.
        I laugh, what use is a crystal sword? But
        I graciously accepted the gift.
    </p>
    <p>
        He is handsome, youthful, and
        charming. In truth, he reminds me of my
        younger years…
    </p>
    <p>
        He has never known war, and never will
        with the peace that I have brought him.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because of my sacrifices he is a kind
        and giving soul; willing to stretch out a
        helping hand to any and all. He studies
        in the Priesthood of the Morninglord.
    </p>
    <p>
        His voice is eloquent and his wit quick.
        He speaks with a wisdom of one who
        has lived several lifetimes. His mind is
        like a sponge soaking up endless drops
        of knowledge. We often have friendly
        debates, which I, of course, with my
        greater wisdom and advanced
        knowledge, win.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are as two sides to a coin, one that
        has sat outside on a stone for too many
        years… one side is weather-worn yet
        the other is fresh and new having been
        protected from the elements.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is good to be with family again.

        This morning my brother Sergei entered
        my study in a mood too cheerful to bear,
        too bright and youthful to tolerate. He’s
        met a girl from the village of such virtue
        and beauty he plans to marry her.
    </p>
    <p>
        Of course, I was furious.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sergei was destined to embark on a life
        of service to the church! He was to be
        our Most High Priest. He had already
        been given the Priest’s Pendant to wear
        as a symbol of the approaching
        ceremony, and here he was bubbling
        over with ludicrous devotion to a
        peasant!

        Fate, it seems, is on my side.
    </p>
    <p>
        These past few months I have
        welcomed an interesting partner into my
        life, Patrina Velikovna, one of the
        estranged dusk elves that live in the
        valley.Her elvish charm and ageless
        beauty belie her true skill. She is a
        cunning witch and as powerful as she is
        beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
        She tells of a place of power, a vault of
        forbidden lore high in the frozen peaks
        of the Balinok Mountains.The Amber
        Temple, where the secret to gaining
        immortality is hidden.
    </p>
    <p>
        Rahadin protested my involvement with
        her.
    </p>
    <p>
        Though he has been a longtime servant
        and confidant of my family, he oversteps
        himself.

    </p>
    <p>
        I fell in love!
    </p>
    <p>
        I say it simply because it happened
        simply. At the first sight of her, I knew
        she was far beyond ordinary beauty as
        the luster of a jewel is beyond that of
        polished glass.
    </p>
    <p>
        A rare beauty, who is called “perfection,”
        “joy,” and “treasure.” Tatyana… I long
        for her to be mine.
    </p>
    <p>
        I love her with all my heart. I love her for
        her youth. I love her for her joy. Tatyana
        is my life.

        “Old one,” is my name to her – “Elder”

        They asked for my blessing and it was a
        blow more crippling than that inflicted by
        any Terg warrior.
    </p>
    <p>
        With words she calls me “Brother,” but
        when I look into her eyes, they reflected
        another name:
    </p>
    <p>
        “Death.”
    </p>
    <p>
        It is the death of the aged that she sees
        in me. She loves her youth and enjoys
        it… but I… I have… squandered mine.
    </p>
    <p>
        All goodness has slipped from my life.
        The war years and the killing years have
        worn down my soul as wind wears stone
        to sand. My youth and strength are
        gone, and all I have left is death.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sergei is full of youth and life. A life that
        was filled with the love of a mother. A
        life that was denied to me. My joy for
        him fades. I hate his handsomeness. I
        hate his youth.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is the death in me that turns her from
        me.
    </p>
    <p>
        I hate death - my death.
    </p>
    <p>
        My hate is very strong.

        My brother is no more than a cold
        obstacle to me now.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have left the castle, the incessant
        cooing of my traitorous brother for my
        love Tatyana is more than I can bear.
    </p>
    <p>
        I travel with Patrina into the Balinok
        Mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
        This land was ancient and powerful long
        before mere man set foot here. I have
        discovered the temple high in the
        mountains, easily two millennia old… I
        have scoured it for its secrets and found
        that the inhabitants, though dead, are
        very useful. It is here that I encountered
        the steward of the temple, an undead
        lich called Exethanter. Even after selling
        his soul for everlasting life this pathetic
        creature is nowhere close to my equal.
        He sensed my greatness, and, as not to
        incur my wrath, lead me toward destiny.
    </p>
    <p>
        The temple is a tomb, a vault of sorts,
        built to contain these remnants of
        ancient powers. Ancient intelligent
        beings. Dangerous to lesser men.
    </p>
    <p>
        All of them supplicated themselves
        before me…
    </p>
    <p>
        …and I found what I wanted.

        I found Tatyana weeping in the garden
        east of the chapel. I expressed my love
        to her, confessed my crime, and she
        fled from me!
    </p>
    <p>
        She would not let me explain, and a
        great anger swelled within me. She had
        to understand the pact I made.

    <p>
        The pact I made for <strong>her!</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="text-center">
        I pursued her…
    </p>

        Finally, in her despair, she flung herself

        watched… everything I ever wanted…
        fall from my grasp forever. A thousand
        feet through the mists.

        No trace of her was ever found.

        me from movement.

        I have become the <strong>Land</strong>.

        A new power has contacted me. A new Dark Power. No power can compare to that of Vampyr. I have no need of this
        new Dark Power. No need of Sykane.
