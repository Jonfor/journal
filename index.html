            Finally, after twenty-six years, the Tergs
            are defeated.Our people shall never
            know of my sacrifice. I have given so
            much, but my familyâ€™s ancestral lands
            are free once again and I have avenged
            the death of Father.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pathetic cowards that they were, the
            Tergs fled west to a small valley in the
            Balinok mountains to hide and lick their
            wounds. Looking back now, it astounds
            me how their barbarian hordes, with
            terrifying speed, overtook our entire
            nation nearly shattering its power,
            unseating my family, but I slaughtered
            them all!
        </p>
        <p>
            I thundered across the land like the
            wrath of a just god, and it was my justice
            that brought peace to the valley. I claim
            the right to rule over this land and all
            lands reclaimed from those barbarians.
            The peasantry is grateful to, once again,
            be under the rule of a von Zarovich. This
            is my just reward.
